# SkyNet-Air-Traffic-Control-ATC-Simulator
In this project, My teammate and I are implementing SkyNet, a console-based Air Traffic Control (ATC) simulator. The system will simulate a busy airspace where aircraft must be managed efficiently to prevent collisions, handle emergencies, and ensure timely landings. We are using data structures like Graphs, Trees, Hashing, Link list and Min-heap.
